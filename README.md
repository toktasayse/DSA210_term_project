# Menstrual Cycle and Step Count Analysis

## Motivation

My curiosity about this subject stems from noticing fluctuations in my activity levels during certain times of the month and wanting to explore whether these changes align with my menstrual cycle. This project explores the potential correlation between menstrual periods and daily step counts. The goal is to investigate whether there is a negative correlation between these two variables, offering a data-driven approach to better understand patterns in activity levels.

## Hypothesis
In this project, the relationship between menstrual periods and daily step counts is examined using the following hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀):
There is no correlation between menstrual periods and daily step counts. 

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
There is a negative correlation between menstrual periods and daily step counts.

## Dataset

This project utilizes personal data collected from the following sources:
1. **Clue Period Tracking App**: Provides data on menstrual cycle dates, including the start and end of periods.
2. **Apple Health App**: Tracks daily step count data.

Both datasets are manually exported from the apps installed on my personal device. The data is anonymized and used exclusively for educational purposes in this term project.

## Project Plan

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   - Export menstrual cycle data from the Clue app.
   - Export daily step count data from the Apple Health app.
   - Preprocess the data to align formats and dates for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summarize and visualize trends in menstrual cycles and step counts.
   - Identify any potential patterns or anomalies in the data.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Test the hypothesis that there is a negative correlation between menstrual periods and daily step counts.
   - Use statistical methods to evaluate the relationship.

4. **Modeling and Insights**
   - Develop a simple model to predict activity levels based on menstrual cycle phases.
   - Interpret the results to provide actionable insights.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize findings and discuss the implications for understanding the relationship between physical activity and the menstrual cycle.
   - Highlight limitations and future directions for similar studies.
